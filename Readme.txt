To start with, you have received 3 files. 

This one, and two others, Wifi Password Hacking part 1, and part 2.

The first think you have to do is to go into part 1 and change the 'wifi name' to the wifi name you want to crack. 

Second, you have to go to part 2 and change where it says 'your username' to the target computer's username'

Next you have to save them. But you can't save them as a txt file, you have to save them as a bat file. 

To do this, you have to go to file > save as. When you are there it will ask you the name of the files. Keep the name was whatever you want, but when you are saving write down the name and then .bat. (Example hacking.bat) 

Once you are done with this, save the files, as all files, and not txt files. You can change this using the dropdown. 

When you are done with that, you have to load the two files onto a usb. 

Once they are on a usb, you will have to plug that usb into someone's computer. 

Once that is done, you will go to file explorer on their computer and run the two bat files

You have to run the bat file named Part 1 first.

Once you see a flicker on the target computer's screen run the second bat file. 

Wait 2 seconds and then plug the usb out.
